This is the code source of the master dissertation: "Sequence to sequence learning with the Variational Information Bottleneck".

## Usage Example
- `python3 run_s2l_image_digit.py --length=5`

## Architecture
Main components:
- Networks: the computational graphs 
- Learners: uses batches to train or test a network
- Batcher: generate batches from a dataset
- Layers: re-usable layer for different networks
